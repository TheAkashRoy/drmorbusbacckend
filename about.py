        "Fungal infection":"Fungal infection, also known as mycosis, is a disease caused by fungi.[5][13] Different types are traditionally divided according to the part of the body affected; superficial, subcutaneous, and systemic.[3][6] Superficial fungal infections include common tinea of the skin, such as tinea of the body, groin, hands, feet and beard, and yeast infections such as pityriasis versicolor.[7] Subcutaneous types include eumycetoma and chromoblastomycosis, which generally affect tissues in and beneath the skin.[1][7] Systemic fungal infections are more serious and include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, pneumocystis pneumonia, aspergillosis and mucormycosis.[3] Signs and symptoms range widely.[3] There is usually a rash with superficial infection.[2] Fungal infection within the skin or under the skin may present with a lump and skin changes.[3] Pneumonia-like symptoms or meningitis may occur with a deeper or systemic infection.[2]",
        "Allergy":"Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, refer to a number of conditions caused by the hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment.[11] These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis.[1] Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling.[12] Note: food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.[3][4]",
        "GERD":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is one of the upper gastrointestinal chronic diseases in which stomach content persistently and regularly flows up into the esophagus, resulting in symptoms and/or complications.[6][7][10] Symptoms include dental corrosion, dysphagia, heartburn, odynophagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain, extraesophageal symptoms such as chronic cough, hoarseness, reflux-induced laryngitis, or asthma.[10] In the long term, and when not treated, complications such as esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett's esophagus may arise.[6]",
        "Chronic cholestasis":"Cholestasis is a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum. The two basic distinctions are an obstructive type of cholestasis where there is a mechanical blockage in the duct system that can occur from a gallstone or malignancy, and metabolic types of cholestasis which are disturbances in bile formation that can occur because of genetic defects or acquired as a side effect of many medications. Classification is further divided into acute or chronic and extrahepatic or intrahepatic.",
        "Drug Reaction":"A drug allergy is the reaction of the immune system to a medicine. Any medicine — nonprescription, prescription or herbal — can provoke a drug allergy. However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medicines.The most common symptoms of drug allergy are hives, rash or fever. But a drug allergy also may cause serious reactions. This includes a severe, life-threatening condition known as anaphylaxis.A drug allergy is not the same as a drug side effect. A side effect is a known possible reaction to a medicine. Side effects to medicines are listed on their drug labels. A drug allergy also is different from drug toxicity. Drug toxicity is caused by an overdose of medicine.",
        "Peptic ulcer diseae":"An ulcer is a discontinuity or break in a bodily membrane that impedes normal function of the affected organ. According to Robbins's pathology, ulcer is the breach of the continuity of skin, epithelium or mucous membrane caused by sloughing out of inflamed necrotic tissue.",
        "AIDS":"Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),[9][10][11] a retrovirus.[12] Following initial infection an individual may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness.[4] Typically, this is followed by a prolonged incubation period with no symptoms.[5] If the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are rare in people who have normal immune function.[4] These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).[5] This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.[5]",
        "Diabetes": "Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels.[11][12] Diabetes is caused by either a lack of insulin-secreting beta-cells in the pancreas due to an autoimmune response (type 1 diabetes), an imbalance between blood sugar level and insulin production (type 2 diabetes), and can be precipitated by pregnancy (gestational diabetes).[13] Diabetes, if left untreated, leads to many health complications.[3] Untreated or poorly treated diabetes accounts for approximately 1.5 million deaths per year.[11]",
        "Gastroenteritis":"Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea and gastro, is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach and intestine.[8] Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.[1] Fever, lack of energy, and dehydration may also occur.[2][3] This typically lasts less than two weeks.[8] It is not related to influenza, even though in the U.S. it is sometimes called the stomach flu.[9]",
        "Bronchial Asthma":"Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs.[5] It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms.[10][11] Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.[4] These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week.[5] Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.[5]",
        "Hypertension":"Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.[11] High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms.[1] Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.[2][3][4][12] Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.[13]",
        "Migraine":"Migraine (UK: /ˈmiːɡreɪn/, US: /ˈmaɪ-/)[12][13] is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent headaches.[1] Typically, the associated headache affects one side of the head, is pulsating in nature, may be moderate to severe in intensity, and could last from a few hours to three days.[1] Non-headache symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.[2] The pain is generally made worse by physical activity during an attack,[14] although regular physical exercise may prevent future attacks.[15] Up to one-third of people affected have aura: typically, it is a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur.[14] Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom.[16]",
        "Cervical spondylosis":"Spondylosis is the degeneration of the vertebral column from any cause. In the more narrow sense it refers to spinal osteoarthritis, the age-related wear and tear of the spinal column, which is the most common cause of spondylosis. The degenerative process in osteoarthritis chiefly affects the vertebral bodies, the neural foramina and the facet joints (facet syndrome). If severe, it may cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots with subsequent sensory or motor disturbances, such as pain, paresthesia, imbalance, and muscle weakness in the limbs.",
        "Paralysis (brain hemorrhage)":"Paralysis (also known as plegia) is a loss of motor function in one or more muscles. Paralysis can also be accompanied by a loss of feeling (sensory loss) in the affected area if there is sensory damage. In the United States, roughly 1 in 50 people have been diagnosed with some form of permanent or transient paralysis.[1] The word paralysis derives from the Greek παράλυσις, meaning disabling of the nerves[2] from παρά (para) meaning beside, by[3] and λύσις (lysis) meaning making loose.[4] A paralysis accompanied by involuntary tremors is usually called palsy.[5][6]",
        "Jaundice":"Jaundice, also known as icterus, is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and sclera due to high bilirubin levels.[3][6] Jaundice in adults is typically a sign indicating the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism, liver dysfunction, or biliary-tract obstruction.[7] The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common, with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life.[8] The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness,[2] pale feces, and dark urine.[4]",
        "Malaria":"Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals.[5][6][3] Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches.[1][7] In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death.[1] Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.[3] If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.[3] In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.[1] This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.[1]",
    "Chicken pox":"Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV).[3] The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over.[1] It usually starts on the chest, back, and face.[1] It then spreads to the rest of the body.[1] The rash and other symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, and headaches, usually last five to seven days.[1] Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections.[7] The disease is usually more severe in adults than in children.[8]",
    "Dengue":"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.[1] Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.[2] These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin itching and skin rash.[1][2] Recovery generally takes two to seven days.[1] In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into a more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.[1][2]",
    "Typhoid":"Typhoid fever, also known as typhoid, is a disease caused by Salmonella serotype Typhi bacteria.[2] Symptoms vary from mild to severe, and usually begin six to 30 days after exposure.[3][4] Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days.[3] This is commonly accompanied by weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, and mild vomiting.[4][5] Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots.[4] In severe cases, people may experience confusion.[5] Without treatment, symptoms may last weeks or months.[4] Diarrhea may be severe, but is uncommon.[5] Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected, but they are still able to spread the disease.[6] Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever, along with paratyphoid fever.[2] S. enterica Typhi is believed to infect and replicate only within humans.[7]",
    "hepatitis A":"Hepatitis A is an infectious disease of the liver caused by Hepatovirus A (HAV);[6] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[7] Many cases have few or no symptoms, especially in the young.[1] The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is 2–6 weeks.[2] When symptoms occur, they typically last 8 weeks and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain.[1] Around 10–15% of people experience a recurrence of symptoms during the 6 months after the initial infection.[1] Acute liver failure may rarely occur, with this being more common in the elderly.[1]",
    "Hepatitis B":"Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver;[1][6] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[7] It can cause both acute and chronic infection.[1]Many people have no symptoms during an initial infection. For others, symptoms may appear 30 to 180 days after becoming infected and can include a rapid onset of sickness with nausea, vomiting, yellowish skin, fatigue, dark urine, and abdominal pain.[1] Symptoms during acute infection typically last for a few weeks, though some people may feel sick for up to six months.",
    "Hepatitis C":"Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver;[2] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[7] During the initial infection period, people often have mild or no symptoms.[1] Early symptoms can include fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin.[1] The virus persists in the liver, becoming chronic, in about 70% of those initially infected.[8] Early on, chronic infection typically has no symptoms.[1] Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.[1] In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.[2]",
    "Hepatitis D":"Hepatitis D is a type of viral hepatitis[3] caused by the hepatitis delta virus (HDV).[4][5] HDV is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. HDV is considered to be a satellite (a type of subviral agent) because it can propagate only in the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV).[6] Transmission of HDV can occur either via simultaneous infection with HBV (coinfection) or superimposed on chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B carrier state (superinfection).",
    "Hepatitis E":"Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV);[4][5] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[6] Hepatitis E has mainly a fecal-oral transmission route that is similar to hepatitis A, although the viruses are unrelated.[7][8][9] In retrospect, the earliest known epidemic of hepatitis E occurred in 1955 in New Delhi,[10] but the virus was not isolated until 1983 by Russian scientists investigating an outbreak in Afghanistan.[11] HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded, nonenveloped, RNA icosahedral virus and one of five known human hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.",
    "Alcoholic hepatitis":"Alcoholic hepatitis is hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) due to excessive intake of alcohol.[2] Patients typically have a history of at least 10 years of heavy alcohol intake, typically 8-10 drinks per day.[3] It is usually found in association with fatty liver, an early stage of alcoholic liver disease, and may contribute to the progression of fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis. Symptoms may present acutely after a large amount of alcoholic intake in a short time period, or after years of excess alcohol intake. Signs and symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), fatigue and hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure).[3] Mild cases are self-limiting, but severe cases have a high risk of death. Severe cases may be treated with glucocorticoids. The condition often comes on suddenly and may progress in severity very rapidly.",
    "Tuberculosis":"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria.[1] Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body.[1] Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.[1] Around 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kill about half of those affected.[1] Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.[1] It was historically referred to as consumption due to the weight loss associated with the disease.[8] Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.[9",
    "Common Cold":"The common cold or the cold is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx.[6][8] Signs and symptoms may appear fewer than two days after exposure to the virus.[6] These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever.[3][4] People usually recover in seven to ten days,[3] but some symptoms may last up to three weeks.[7] Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.[3]",
    "Pneumonia":"Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli.[3][14] Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing.[15] The severity of the condition is variable.[15]Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms.[a] Identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination.[8] Chest X-rays, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis.[8] The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.[18]",
    "Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)":"Hemorrhoids (or haemorrhoids), also known as piles, are vascular structures in the anal canal.[7][8] In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control.[2] They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term hemorrhoid is often used to refer to the disease.[8] The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present.[4] Internal hemorrhoids often result in painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating.[3][4] External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus.[4] If bleeding occurs, it is usually darker.[4] Symptoms frequently get better after a few days.[3] A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.[4]",
    "Heart attack":"A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to the coronary artery of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle.[1] The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck or jaw.[1] Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes.[1] The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn.[1] Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat or feeling tired.[1] About 30% of people have atypical symptoms.[8] Women more often present without chest pain and instead have neck pain, arm pain or feel tired.[11] Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms.[12] An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.[3][4]",
    "Varicose veins":"Varicose veins, also known as varicoses, are a medical condition in which superficial veins become enlarged and twisted.[1][2] These veins typically develop in the legs, just under the skin.[3] Varicose veins usually cause few symptoms. However, some individuals may experience fatigue or pain in the area.[2] Complications can include bleeding or superficial thrombophlebitis.[2][1] Varices in the scrotum are known as a varicocele, while those around the anus are known as hemorrhoids.[1] Due to the various physical, social, and psychological effects of varicose veins, they can negatively affect one's quality of life.[5]",
    "Hypothyroidism":"Hypothyroidism (also called underactive thyroid, low thyroid or hypothyreosis) is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.[3] It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, slow heart rate, depression, and weight gain.[3] Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goiter.[3] Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.[5]",
    "Hyperthyroidism":"Hyperthyroidism is the condition that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.[3] Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism.[3] Some, however, use the terms interchangeably.[4] Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, hand tremor, and weight loss.[1] Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy.[1] An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death.[2] The opposite is hypothyroidism, when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.[5]",
    "Hypoglycemia":"Hypoglycemia, also called low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to levels below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).[1][3] Whipple's triad is used to properly identify hypoglycemic episodes.[2] It is defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, and resolution of symptoms when blood sugar returns to normal.[2] Hypoglycemia may result in headache, tiredness, clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, fast heart rate, sweating, shakiness, nervousness, hunger, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death.[1][3][2] Symptoms typically come on quickly.[1]",
    "Osteoarthristis":"",
    "Arthritis":"Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints.[2] Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness.[2] Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints.[2][3] In some types of arthritis, other organs are also affected.[6] Onset can be gradual or sudden.[5]",
    "(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo":"Vertigo is a condition in which a person has the sensation of movement or of surrounding objects moving when they are not.[1] Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement.[1][2] This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking.[2] It is typically worse when the head is moved.[2] Vertigo is the most common type of dizziness.[2]",
    "Acne":"Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin condition that occurs when dead skin cells and oil from the skin clog hair follicles.[10] Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring.[1][2][11] It primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back.[12] The resulting appearance can lead to lack of confidence, anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.[3][4]",
    "Urinary tract infection":"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract.[1] When it affects the lower urinary tract it is known as a bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as a kidney infection (pyelonephritis).[10] Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder.[1] Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI.[10] Rarely the urine may appear bloody.[7] In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.[1][11]",
    "Psoriasis":"Psoriasis is a long-lasting, noncontagious[4] autoimmune disease characterized by raised areas of abnormal skin.[5] These areas are red, pink, or purple,[8] dry, itchy, and scaly.[3] Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage.[3] Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon.[9]",
    "Impetigo":"Impetigo is a bacterial infection that involves the superficial skin.[2] The most common presentation is yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs.[2] Less commonly there may be large blisters which affect the groin or armpits.[2] The lesions may be painful or itchy.[3] Fever is uncommon.[3] It is typically due to either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.[3] Risk factors include attending day care, crowding, poor nutrition, diabetes mellitus, contact sports, and breaks in the skin such as from mosquito bites, eczema, scabies, or herpes.[3][4] With contact it can spread around or between people.[3] Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and appearance."
